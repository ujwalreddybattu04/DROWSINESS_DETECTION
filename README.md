# DROWSINESS_DETECTION
Drowsiness Detection System
This project implements a Drowsiness Detection System using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system monitors the live video feed to detect signs of drowsiness and provides timely alerts to prevent accidents.

Features
Real-time video feed analysis using OpenCV.
Eye state detection using pre-trained deep learning models.
Alerts the user upon detecting signs of drowsiness.
Highly customizable and easy to use.
